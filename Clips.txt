Go into your inventory and find a crafting table. Build the crafting table so then you can make the tools. After that.  Make sticks and create your tools. To get stone, you would have to go mine stone so then you can get stone tools.</p>

<h2> Clip #3</h2>

<p> In Clip 3, I will teach what to look for when you are mining. The first thing you would want to do is to get alot of stone and sticks to create stone pickaxes. Once you have a lot of them, mine down and look for coal or iron. Iron, you can use it to make better tools to mine diamonds.</p>

Leave one whole on whatever side for the door. Then build up three blocks on all sides accept the one column were the door goes. Next you will want to build a roof. You can either make it flat or make it like a traditional house. After that create a floor and theres your house. </p>

<h2> Clip #5</h2>

<p> In Clip #5, I will show you how to create a neather portal. First, you will have to go to the bottom of the world and try to find lava.
