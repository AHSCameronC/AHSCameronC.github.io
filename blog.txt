<p>	Video games are so enticing because you can have fun in them. You get to control a character in some games where you can do all sorts of things. I would say people like to play video games just because they either want to pass time or just to have fun. I know I play video games because it passes the time and also they are fun to play. I feel like video games help your reaction time in anything, like if you are playing a game and something comes at you, and you want to dodge it. You have to have a reaction. That is another reason why I think people like playing games just so they can build their reaction time.</p>

<p>The gaming computer that I would pick would be from apex gaming Pc's. I would get the apex lux build. This gaming computer could do anything you would be needing in a computer. It is very pricy, but it is very expensive. About 9 thousand dollars to buy. But a expensive computer means that it is a good computer.</p>

<p>	Rainbow Six siege is a good game. At Least it used to be. I Haven't played it in months just because i havent had internet. But it was fun to play with friends. Playing casual was very fun either with your friends or just by yourself. But there are not so good times when your playing ranked and you loose a 1v1. They all get mad. Other than that. The game is fun.     The game that I do not like is Call Of Duty. Its a fun game. But when the bugs and stuff starts to happen. It makes the game not fun at all. I would say verdansk was better than whatever we have now.</p>

<p>	What is toxicity? Toxicity is the worst thing to happen in a gaming community. Toxicity is where people say things about either you or others in a bad way. A toxic person is someone who is subtly or outwardly manipulative, self-centered, needy, or controlling. Ways we can beat toxicity is not raging at a game if you die. You can also just be more positive and not always yelling at your teammates if they're not the best. </p>

<p>	Dark Zero is an esports team for the game called Rainbow Six Siege. They have their own custom skins and everything. They were really popular last year and the year before but they have kinda died out. They do well in flanking and their aim is really good. Coms is one thing that they could work on because they have lost games because someone didn't know where the enemy was. </p> </body>
